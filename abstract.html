<p><h2>ABOUT MUSIC</h2></p>
<p><h5>Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound organized in time. 
General definitions of music include common elements such as pitch (which governs melody
 and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics
 (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes
 termed the "color" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, 
de-emphasize or omit some of these elements.</h5></p></div>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
<img src="forest.jpg"  width="50%" height="100%">
<p><h2>ABOUT FOREST</h2></p>
<p><h5>A forest is a large area dominated by trees.[1] Hundreds of more precise definitions 
of forest are used throughout the world, incorporating factors such as tree density, tree height,
 land use, legal standing and ecological function.[2][3][4] According to the widely used[5][6] Food 
and Agriculture Organization definition, forests covered 4 billion hectares (9.9×109 acres) 
(15 million square miles) or approximately 30 percent of the world's land area in 2006.</h5></p></div>

<p><h2>ABOUT ANIMALS</h2></p>
<p><h5>Animals are multicellular eukaryotic organisms that form the biological kingdom Animalia. 
With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, can 
reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic 
development. Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described—of which around 1 million
 are insects—but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total. Animals range
 in length from 8.5 millionths of a metre to 33.6 metres (110 ft) and have complex interactions with
 each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs.

<div class="col-sm-4">
<img src="love.jpg" width="50%" height="100%">
<p><h2>ABOUT LOVE</h2></p>
<p><h5>Love encompasses a range of strong and positive emotional and mental states, from the most
 sublime virtue or good habit, the deepest interpersonal affection and to the simplest pleasure.[1][2] An 
example of this range of meanings is that the love of a mother differs from the love of a spouse, which 
differs from the love of food. Most commonly, love refers to a feeling of strong attraction and emotional
 attachment.</h5></p></div>

<div class="col-sm-4">
<img src="food.jpg" width="50%" height="100%">
<p><h2>ABOUT FOOD</h2></p>
<p><h5>Food is any substance[1] consumed to provide nutritional support for an organism.
 It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats,
 proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the 
organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth.Historically, humans secured food 
through two methods: hunting and gathering and agriculture. Today, the majority of the food energy 
required by the ever increasing population of the world is supplied by the food industry.</h5></p></div>


<div class="col-sm-4">
<img src="family.png" width="50%" height="100%">
<p><h2>ABOUT FAMILY</h2></p>
<p><h5>In the context of human society, a family (from Latin: familia) is a group of people related 
either by consanguinity (by recognized birth), affinity (by marriage or other relationship), or 
co-residence (as implied by the etymology of the English word "family")[citation needed] or some 
combination of these.[citation needed] Members of the immediate family may include spouses, parents,
 brothers, sisters, sons, and daughters.[citation needed] Members of the extended family may include
 grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, nephews, nieces, and siblings-in-law.[citation needed] Sometimes
 these are also considered members of the immediate family, depending on an individual's specific
 relationship with them.</h5></p></div>

<div class="col-sm-4">
<img src="mobile.jpg" width="50%" height="100%">
<p><h2>ABOUT MOBILES</h2></p>
<p><h5>A mobile phone, cell phone, cellphone, or hand phone, sometimes shortened to simply 
mobile, cell or just phone, is a portable telephone that can make and receive calls over a radio 
frequency link while the user is moving within a telephone service area. The radio frequency link
 establishes a connection to the switching systems of a mobile phone operator, which provides access
 to the public switched telephone network (PSTN).</h5></p></div>
